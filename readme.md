# pr-sketch

A personal sketching space for maps made with [`mixmap`](https://github.com/peermaps/mixmap). The aim is to explore expressive cartography. Each script is a snapshot of an idea, those with more numbers appended to the name tend to be more considered. For example, there is this [alien topography map of Puerto Rico](https://rubenrodriguez.me/sketches/mixmap-pr-speckle-04-01/), the source of which is here as [mixmap-pr-speckle-04-01.js](./mixmap-pr-speckle-04-01.js).
